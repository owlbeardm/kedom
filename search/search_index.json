pathfinder If you don't know whats \"Pathfinder 2E\" is or if you didn't play tabletop role-playing game before check out quick summary of rules from Archives of Nethys. Especially Getting Started in How to Play section. Almost all decribed options can be found in Archives of Nethys . If something is differ from original rules and setting I would specify it here. Players can select any valid Common option. Uncommon , Rare and Unique options can be selected after consulting with GM. Character Creation Step 1. Create a Concept This includes such options as Ancestry , Background , Class . It doesn't have to be exact mechanical options. Just vague copcept of what you hero will be. Create a name for you character (Please use guidlines and consult with GM). In this setting rarity of Classes and Ancestries are differs from original rules: Classes Common Classes Alchemist Barbarian Bard Champion Cleric Druid Fighter Investigator Oracle Ranger Rogue Sorcerer Swashbuckler Witch Wizard Uncommon Classes Monk TBD Classes (rules not released yet) Gunslinger Inventor Magus Summoner Ancestries Common Ancestries Dwarf Gnome Halfling Half-human (Half-Elf/Half-Orc) Human Lizardfolk Ratfolk Uncommon Ancestries Elf Fetchling Goblin Hobgoblin Kobold Leshy Ork Aasimar ( Versatile Heritage ) Changeling ( Versatile Heritage ) Ganzi ( Versatile Heritage ) Sylph ( Versatile Heritage ) Tiefling ( Versatile Heritage ) Versatile Heritage means that this option placed on top of regular Ancestry. Rare and unique Ancestries The rest Step 2. Ancestry Pick the ancestry itself: Ancestries . Select a heritage from those available within that ancestry. (Can be found in Heritages submenu on selected Ancestry page) Choose an ancestry feat , representing an ability your hero learned at an early age. (Can be found in Feats submenu on selected Ancestry page) Step 3. Class Pick a class: Classes Note a Key Ability of this class. Class almost always have suboption (like Research Fields for Alchemist or Arcane Schools and Arcane Thesis for wizard). Consider what would you like for your hero. (This options can be found in submenu on selected Class page). Step 4. Background Pick a Background: Backgrounds Note ability boosts it provides. Mark Skill and Skill Feat it provides. All General Backgrounds are common. Legacy and Regional backgrounds should be discussed with GM. Step 5. Abilities At first level every hero recieves 4 free ability boosts in addition to ancestry, class and background boosts. You class page has Class Features table. Read features for first level and select required options if it has variants. If options are match you can select any other variant. For example your class and you background provides trained proficiency in same skill that means you gain trained in that skill and any other skill you choose. Step 6. Equipment New Hero starts with 15 gp. You can save time by buying kit for you class: Class Kits . Or you can buy all equipment yourself: Equipment Equipment info Armor, shields, and weapons have all of the mundane armaments needed for combat, as well as ones made of precious materials or that possess special magical abilities. Other nonmagical gear can be found under the adventuring gear category. Alchemical items are powered by the reactions of alchemical reagents. Almost all alchemical items are consumable items that are used up when you activate them and this category includes bombs, elixirs, poisons, and other alchemical tools. Consumables are used up when you activate them, and include ammunition, oils, potions, scrolls, and talismans, among others. Categories of items that are consumables but have specific rules, such as alchemical items, are presented separately. Held Items include a wide variety of items you use with your hands but doesn't include more narrow categories of held items, such as weapons. Materials can be used to make items with unique properties and other advantages. Runes modify armor and weapons when etched onto them. This section includes fundamental runes for weapons (weapon potency and striking) and armor (armor potency and resilient). Snares are single-use traps typically made by rangers. Staves provide flexible spellcasting options. Structures include buildings, tents, and other larger items. Wands hold a spell of the crafter's choice, and can be used to repeatedly cast that spell. Worn Items consist of a vast collection of clothing and other items you wear on your body. Step 7. The rest Calculations of modifies and stats from all options selected. If you use character.pf2.tools it is done automatically. Creating caracter using character.pf2.tools Step 1. Concept Lets's create Merlin character. That makes him human wizard with already established name. Merlin's traditional biography casts him as a cambion, a being born of a mortal woman, sired by an incubus. That makes him tiefling . Merlin matures to an ascendant sagehood and engineers the birth of Arthur through magic and intrigue. Some king of scholar character. Step 2. Ancestry Merlin is Human . Which gives him 8 hp , medium size , 25 feet land speed , 2 free ability boosts , Common + 1 + your Intelligence modifier additional languages . His Human Heritage will be Tiefling Versatile Heritage. Which gives him low-light vision . And ability to choose tiefling ancestry feats. For his ancestry feat we'll choose Devil's Advocate . Step 3. Class We established that Merlin is Wizard . Often called enchanter. Wizard's Key Ability: INTELLIGENCE . And wizard gets 6 plus your Constitution modifier hit points per level. Wizard gets two subclass options. Arcane School would be Enchantment (since he's called enchanter). His Arcane Thesis would be Metamagical Experimentation . Step 4. Background Merlin's background would be Scholar . Which gives Int or Wis and free ability boost. Trained proficiency in Arcana , Nature , Occultism , or Religion skill, and the Academia Lore skill. And Assurance skill feat. Step 5. Abilities 4 free abilities: Wizard's class features are: ancestry and background : already done initial proficiencies : trained in Perception Fortitude Reflex Expert in Will Arcana (already trained from background, so changed to Occultism) number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier (which is 2+4) club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, and staff unarmed attacks unarmored defense arcane spell attacks and arcane spell DCs arcane spellcasting : giving 5 cantrips slots and 2 1st level spells per day. And spellbook with 10 cantrips and 5 1st-level spells. We will use Sample Spellbook . arcane school gives us +1 enchantment spell (charm) to the book and charming words focus spell. arcane bond class feature arcane thesis : METAMAGICAL EXPERIMENTATION gives us metamagic feat. We'll choose Reach Spell . Step 6. Equipment Wizard Kit comes with staff , adventurer's pack , material component pouch , writing set and optional crossbow with 20 bolts . We'll take all of it which lefts us with 8 gp 8 sp. Step 7. The rest All bonuses are automatically calculated. But Merlin doesn't have any attacks displayed. We'll add staff and crossbow that are already bought: Extra Step. Character setup I'm using Expanded Rules in this setting. So some options should be enabled in character.pf2.tools when character created: Proficiency without Level : use no level in bonuses.

During a <strong>round</strong> every participant gets to take a turn, after which a new round begins.</p><p>The order of action is determined by <strong>Initiative</strong>. To determine initiative, each side rolls <em>1d8</em> and adds the highest <em>Dexterity</em> modifier in the group. NPCs usually have no modifier, unless the GM decides they’re exceptionally quick. The side with the highest roll goes first in whatever order the members choose, and then the other sides act in their respective order. The PC party wins any initiative ties. At the end of the <strong>round</strong>, it cycles back to the first group and repeats accordingly.</p><p>In some cases a group may be ambushed or surprised by a foe. The more alert the targets, the more difficult it is to ambush them.</p><p>If the GM decides that surprise is possible, an opposed <em>Wis/Notice</em> versus <em>Dex/Sneak</em> skill check should be rolled. If the attackers win, they surprise the targets and get <strong>a full round of action</strong> to themselves before initiative is rolled and the combat progresses as usual. An ambush might also provoke a Morale check in undisciplined or unmilitary targets at the GM’s discretion.</p><h2 id="actions-in-combat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#actions-in-combat"><span>Actions in Combat</span></a></h2><p>When it’s a given participant’s turn in combat, they can take their action. There are four different kinds of actions in combat or other time-sensitive situations.</p><ul><li><strong>Main Actions</strong> are actions that take up most of the actor’s <strong>round</strong>. Attacking someone, manipulating some device, applying first aid to a downed ally, casting a spell, or other complex actions that would take several seconds to perform are all <strong>Main Actions</strong>. A participant gets one <strong>Main Action</strong> every <strong>round</strong>.</li><li><strong>Move Actions</strong> involve moving up to the participant’s normal movement rate. Thus, a normal human with a movement rate of 30 feet can move up to that distance with a <strong>Move action</strong>. Climbing, swimming, crossing difficult terrain, or other challenging movement usually is only half as fast as normal combat movement. A participant gets one <strong>Move action</strong> per <strong>round</strong>, though they can also choose to spend their <strong>Main Action</strong> taking an additional <strong>Move action</strong> if they wish.<br> A combatant in melee who moves away from their enemy must take a <strong>Fighting Withdrawal</strong> action or suffer a free Instant attack from all enemies in melee with them.<br> A <strong>Move action</strong> must spend all its movement at once; it cannot split it around a <strong>Main Action</strong>. Thus, it’s not possible to move 10 feet, shoot a foe with a <strong>Main Action</strong>, and then dive another 20 feet behind cover.</li><li><strong>On Turn Actions</strong> are quick, simple acts that take very little time and focus to perform, such as falling prone, saying a few words, a skilled archer reloading a bow from a <em>Readied</em> quiver, drawing out a <em>Readied</em> object, or similar things. A participant can only perform an <strong>On Turn action</strong> on their own turn, but they can do as many of them as the GM thinks is reasonable.</li><li><strong>Instant Actions</strong> are so fast and simple that the participant can use them at any time, even when it’s not their turn. They can even use them after the dice have been rolled, delaying their use until they’re sure the action is needed. <strong>Instant actions</strong> are generally related to special powers and abilities or certain magical arts. If multiple <strong>Instant actions</strong> are triggered at the same time, they execute in whatever order the GM thinks is most reasonable. There is no limit to the number of <strong>Instant</strong> actions a participant can take.</li></ul><h2 id="attacking-a-foe" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attacking-a-foe"><span>Attacking a Foe</span></a></h2><p>When a combatant wants to harm an enemy, they need to make a <strong>hit roll</strong>. An attack usually counts as a <strong>Main Action</strong> and the assailant must be close enough to actually hit the target with whatever weapon they have to hand.</p><p>To make a hit roll, the attacker rolls a d20 and adds their relevant combat skill, their class attack bonus, and their relevant attribute modifier. If they lack even <em>level-0</em> skill in the weapon being used, they suffer a <em>-2 penalty</em>. Any other situational modifiers or penalties are also added to the roll.</p><p>If the total is equal or greater than the target’s Armor Class, then the attack hits and damage is rolled. If less, then the attack misses. A missed melee attack may still inflict <strong>Shock damage</strong>, if the weapon has a <strong>Shock rating</strong> and the target’s Armor Class is equal or lower than it.</p><p>To roll damage, the attacker rolls the weapon’s listed damage die and adds their relevant attribute modifier and any bonus from a magical weapon, Focus, or other special benefit.</p><p>The damage is then subtracted from the target’s hit points.</p><p>Some attacks may not be lethal in nature. If a non-lethal attack reduces a target to zero hit points, the attacker can choose to simply have their victim be unconscious or helpless, unable to act and reviving ten minutes later with one hit point. Attacks that are psychic or emotional in nature may reduce their victims to helpless shock or numbing confusion when they bring them to zero hit points, likewise incapacitating them for ten minutes.</p><h2 id="hit-roll-modifiers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hit-roll-modifiers"><span>Hit Roll Modifiers</span></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Circumstance</th><th>Mod</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shooting at a distant prone foe</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Shooting or meleeing an adjacent prone foe</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Melee attacking while prone</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>The target is at least half behind cover</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>The target is almost completely in cover</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>Thrown attack while being meleed by a foe</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>Shooting a bow while being meleed by a foe</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="shock-damage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shock-damage"><span>Shock Damage</span></a></h2><p>Some melee attacks inflict <strong>Shock</strong>, the inevitable harm that is done when an unarmored target is assailed by something sharp in melee range.</p><p><strong>Shock</strong> for a weapon is listed in points of damage and the maximum AC affected. Thus &quot;Shock 2/15&quot; means that 2 points of damage are done to any target with AC 15 or less. More heavily-armored targets are immune to the weapon’s <strong>Shock</strong>.</p><p>Weapon’s attribute modifier added to <strong>Shock</strong>, along with any magical bonus to the weapon and any damage bonuses that are explicitly noted as adding to <strong>Shock</strong>. Other damage bonuses do not increase <strong>Shock</strong>.</p><p>An attack never does less damage on a hit than it would do in <strong>Shock</strong>. Thus, if an attack that would normally do 4 points of <strong>Shock</strong> to AC 15 hits a target withi AC 13 and rolls a 3 for damage, 4 points are done instead.</p><h2 id="dual-wielding-weapons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dual-wielding-weapons"><span>Dual-Wielding Weapons</span></a></h2><p>PCs who wish to wield two one-handed weapons at once may do so if they have at least <em>Stab-1</em> skill. Doing so grants them a <em>+2 bonus</em> to damage rolls, albeit not to <strong>Shock</strong>. They suffer a <em>-1 penalty</em> on hit rolls, however, due to the extra complication. Only one weapon may be used to attack in any given <strong>round</strong>, but either one may be used. Unarmed combatants cannot dual-wield.</p><h2 id="shoving" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shoving"><span>Shoving</span></a></h2><p>To shove a target or force them back, the attacker must first hit the target normally for no damage and then succeed in an opposed <em>Str/Punch</em> or <em>Str/Exert</em> skill check. If the attacker succeeds in the skill check, the target is forced back up to ten feet or knocked prone.</p><h2 id="grappling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#grappling"><span>Grappling</span></a></h2><p>To grapple a foe, the attacker must first hit with an unarmed attack, doing no damage, and then both must make opposed <em>Str/Punch</em> skill checks. If the attacker wins, the defender is grappled and remains that way until released or until they spend a <strong>Main Action</strong> and succeed in a new opposed check. An attacker can grapple only one target at a time, though multiple attackers can cling to the same luckless defender. In such cases, the defender’s single skill check is compared against all of their foes.</p><p>While grappling, neither attackers or defenders can move from their current location, nor can they fight with anything but unarmed attacks. <strong>At the end of each round in which a defender remains grappled, they suffer damage from each attacker as if hit with an unarmed attack from each foe grappling them</strong>.</p><p>If the attacker wishes to move the target, they must spend a <strong>Main Action</strong> and succeed in an opposed <em>Str/Punch</em> skill check. If they win, the target is either moved ten feet along with them, or thrown five feet and knocked prone. If they lose, the defender breaks free.</p><p>These rules assume both targets are man-sized. Grappling or shoving significantly larger but still humanoid targets is done at a <em>-2 penalty</em> on all skill checks by the attacker. Doing so to creatures only barely plausible for such manhandling is done at a <em>-4 skill check penalty</em>.</p><h2 id="execution-attacks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#execution-attacks"><span>Execution Attacks</span></a></h2><p>A target that is <strong>completely unaware of danger</strong> is vulnerable to a quick and bloody death, no matter how great their martial prowess or how thick their armor. An <strong>Execution Attack</strong> gives an assailant an opportunity to slay a foe with a single well-placed arrow or blade.</p><p>Setting up such an attack requires a full minute of preparation. Melee assassins must use a weapon for an <strong>Execution Attack</strong>, unless they have such special training as to make their unarmed attacks unusually lethal. If the target is spooked, the opportunity is lost.</p><p>Once the preparation is complete, the assailant may use a <strong>Main Action</strong> to attack. The target’s Armor Class is irrelevant, assuming the attacker is using a weapon that can hurt the target. A melee <strong>Execution Attack</strong> will always hit. A ranged <strong>Execution Attack</strong> requires a <em>Dex/Shoot</em> skill check against a difficulty of <em>6</em> for a point-blank shot, <em>8</em> for one at the weapon’s normal range, and <em>10</em> for a shot at extreme range. A Warrior can use their Veteran’s Luck ability with this skill check, but it only allows a reroll on a failed check rather than forcing an automatic hit.</p><p>If the <strong>Execution Attack</strong> hits, the target must make an immediate <em>Physical saving throw</em> at a penalty equal to the attacker’s combat skill level. If they fail, they are <em>Dead</em> on the spot, or knocked unconscious if the attacker was using a plausibly non-lethal weapon. If they succeed, the weapon still does its <em>maximum damage</em> and adds <em>1 Wound</em>. Attacking an unconscious or incapacitated target will always leave them Dead.</p><h2 id="common-combat-actions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#common-combat-actions"><span>Common Combat Actions</span></a></h2><h3 id="make-a-melee-attack-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#make-a-melee-attack-main-action"><span>Make a Melee Attack (Main Action)</span></a></h3><p>The combatant attacks an enemy within melee range with a <em>Readied</em> weapon, rolling a normal hit roll and inflicting damage on a successful hit. Most melee attacks inflict <strong>Shock</strong> damage on a miss, if the target’s Armor Class is low enough, and no successful hit does less damage than the weapon’s <strong>Shock</strong> would have done on a miss.</p><h3 id="make-a-ranged-attack-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#make-a-ranged-attack-main-action"><span>Make a Ranged Attack (Main Action)</span></a></h3><p>The combatant fires or throws a <em>Readied</em> ranged weapon at a target. The combatant can’t <strong>Make a Ranged Attack</strong> with a two-handed weapon such as a bow if there’s a enemy armed with a melee weapon within melee range; it’s too easy for the assailant to hinder the use of a bow. One-handed ranged weapons and thrown weapons can still be used, albeit at a <em>-4 penalty</em> to hit.</p><h3 id="make-a-snap-attack-instant-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#make-a-snap-attack-instant-action"><span>Make a Snap Attack (Instant Action)</span></a></h3><p>A combatant with a <em>Readied</em> weapon can rush their attack, sacrificing accuracy for speed. The combatant must still have their <strong>Main Action</strong> impending or available. As an <strong>Instant</strong>, they can sacrifice it to make a melee or ranged attack against a foe, whether a snap shot with a bow or a quick thrust at an adjacent melee foe. This attack takes a <em>-4 penalty</em> to its hit roll. If multiple <strong>Snap Attacks</strong> go off at the same time, they are resolved simultaneously. <strong>Snap Attacks</strong> are normally only possible for PCs and other very well-trained or talented combatants. If an opponent isn’t significant enough to have been given a name, they probably shouldn’t be using <strong>Snap Attacks</strong>.</p><h3 id="make-a-swarm-attack-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#make-a-swarm-attack-main-action"><span>Make a Swarm Attack (Main Action)</span></a></h3><p>Each assailant takes this action against a target in range of their current weapon, until up to four have done so. When the final participant has taken this action, one of the mob can elect to make an immediate melee or ranged attack against their target, gaining a <em>+2 bonus</em> to hit and <em>+1</em> to damage for each other surviving attacker, up to <em>+6/+3</em>. This damage bonus does not add to <strong>Shock</strong> and it cannot drive the attack’s damage over the maximum usually possible for the blow, but <strong>Shock</strong> from it always harms the target, even if they have a too-high AC, are using a shield, or have a Focus immunity to <strong>Shock</strong>. The sheer swarming numbers of foes are bound to inflict some kind of harm on the target provided they’re not completely immune to the mob’s weaponry.</p><h2 id="cast-a-spell-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cast-a-spell-main-action"><span>Cast a Spell (Main Action)</span></a></h2><p>An arcanely-gifted PC can cast a spell as a <strong>Main Action</strong>. If they’ve suffered any hit point damage this <strong>round</strong>, drawn or sheathed an item with their spellcasting hand, or have been severely jostled they cannot take this action. If they suffer hit point damage while casting, such as by someone who has held their action to attack at that moment, the spell fizzles uselessly and the spell slot is wasted.</p><h2 id="charge-special" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#charge-special"><span>Charge (Special)</span></a></h2><p>A combatant can make a wild charge before hurling a weapon or crashing into a foe, moving up to twice their normal move in a straight line before making a melee or thrown attack at <em>+2 to hit</em>. The charging attacker must be able to move at least 10 feet to get the requisite momentum and suffers a <em>-2 AC penalty</em> for the rest of the <strong>round</strong>. Charging takes both a <strong>Move</strong> and <strong>Main Action</strong>.</p><h2 id="shatter-a-shield-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shatter-a-shield-main-action"><span>Shatter a Shield (Main Action)</span></a></h2><p>To shatter a shield, the attacker must be using an axe, a mace, a Focus-improved unarmed attack, or some other crushing or hewing attack. The maneuver requires a successful hit roll and then an opposed <em>Str/Stab</em> skill check between the attacker and the defender, with the defender gaining a <em>+1 bonus</em> on their check. No damage is done, but if the attacker wins then the shield will be broken. Magical shields cannot be broken this way. Patching a damaged shield takes a scene’s work and <em>Craft-0</em> skill.</p><h2 id="screen-an-ally-move-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#screen-an-ally-move-action"><span>Screen an Ally (Move Action)</span></a></h2><p>The PC moves up to their normal Move rate towards an ally and then physically blocks opponents from attacking them, provided they remain within ten feet. Until the PC’s next turn, enemies who wish to make a melee or ranged attack against the screened ally must succeed in a successful <em>Str</em> or <em>Dex</em>-based opposed skill check against the PC using the combat skill applicable to their weapon; on a failure, the attack roll is automatically directed toward the screening PC.</p><p>A PC can screen against a number of attackers in one <strong>round</strong> equal to their combat skill; thus, <em>Stab-2</em> lets them block the attacks of two different attackers. PCs with <em>level-0</em> or worse combat skills can’t effectively screen. Multiple PCs can try to screen the same ally; in such a case, the attacker’s skill check is compared against all blockers and the lowest-rolling successful blocker is attacked. PCs can only screen against foes and attacks they could plausibly physically parry or block with a shield.</p><h2 id="total-defense-instant-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#total-defense-instant-action"><span>Total Defense (Instant Action)</span></a></h2><p>As an <strong>Instant</strong> action, the combatant focuses on nothing other than avoiding knives, arrows, hurled crystalline spears, or other perils in the vicinity. Using <strong>Total Defense</strong> costs the user their <strong>Main Action</strong> for the <strong>round</strong>, and cannot be used if they’ve already employed their <strong>Main Action</strong>. They become immune to <strong>Shock</strong> damage for the <strong>round</strong>, including from <strong>Swarm Attacks</strong>, and gain a <em>+2 bonus</em> to their Armor Class until their next turn.</p><h2 id="run-move-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#run-move-action"><span>Run (Move Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant moves their normal combat movement rate, which is 30 feet for most humans. If they’re climbing a surface, swimming, or navigating extremely rough terrain, this movement rate is halved, and they might have to make an <em>Exert</em> skill check to achieve even that. Prone characters crab along at half this rate.</p><h2 id="make-a-fighting-withdrawal-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#make-a-fighting-withdrawal-main-action"><span>Make a Fighting Withdrawal (Main Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant disengages from any melee foes around them. They don’t actually move away, but they can now get away from their assailants without giving them a free melee attack. Usually, this means the combatant uses their <strong>Move</strong> action to get clear, because if they just stand there the enemies might choose to re-engage them.</p><h2 id="use-a-skill-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-a-skill-main-action"><span>Use a Skill (Main Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few seconds. An <em>Int/Heal</em> or <em>Dex/Heal</em> skill check to stabilize a wounded comrade is one such potential use, as is turning a creaking engine wheel, shouting out a stirring rallying cry to timorous NPC allies, or anything else that might be done quickly.</p><h2 id="ready-or-stow-an-item-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ready-or-stow-an-item-main-action"><span>Ready or Stow an Item (Main Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant draws a weapon, extracts an item from their backpack, digs a potion out of a belt pouch, or otherwise moves an object around on their person. They can <strong>Ready</strong> an item this way or <strong>Stow</strong> it.</p><h2 id="reload-a-weapon-main-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reload-a-weapon-main-action"><span>Reload a Weapon (Main Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant reloads a weapon like a crossbow or an ancient projectile launcher with a <em>Readied</em> magazine or a quarrel from a <em>Readied</em> quiver. Bows can be reloaded as an <strong>On Turn</strong> action, assuming the archer has a <em>Readied</em> quiver and <em>Shoot-1</em> skill; otherwise it’s a <strong>Move</strong> action.</p><h2 id="drop-an-item-instant-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#drop-an-item-instant-action"><span>Drop an Item (Instant Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant drops something they’re holding. They can do this Instantly at any time to free up their hands.</p><h2 id="pick-up-an-item-move-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pick-up-an-item-move-action"><span>Pick up an Item (Move Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant can scoop an object off the floor if they have a free hand, leaving it <em>Readied</em> in their grip.</p><h2 id="stand-up-move-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stand-up-move-action"><span>Stand Up (Move Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant gets up from a prone position, gathering any dropped belongings. Most characters that have just been revived from unconsciousness must get up before they do much else.</p><h2 id="go-prone-on-turn-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#go-prone-on-turn-action"><span>Go Prone (On Turn Action)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant falls flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take a <em>-2 penalty</em> to hit them. Adjacent melee enemies find them an easier target, however, gaining <em>+2 to hit</em>.</p><h2 id="hold-an-action-move-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hold-an-action-move-action"><span>Hold An Action (Move Action)</span></a></h2><p>By choosing to <strong>Hold An Action</strong>, the combatant can delay taking the rest of their actions until later in the <strong>round</strong>, activating them as an <strong>Instant</strong> action. Thus, a hero who wins initiative might use their <strong>Move</strong> action to <strong>Hold An Action</strong>. Later in the <strong>round</strong>, as an enemy rushes around a corner, he may Instantly elect to use his <strong>Main Action</strong> to <strong>Make A Ranged Attack</strong> with his readied crossbow. If acting in response to someone else’s impending action, the held action is resolved first.</p><h2 id="delay-an-action-on-turn" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#delay-an-action-on-turn"><span>Delay an Action (On Turn)</span></a></h2><p>The combatant simply chooses to delay the remainder of their actions this turn until after a particular other participant has acted. Such a pause may be needed for some tactical plan or to respond to a particular enemy’s action. Unlike <strong>Hold An Action</strong>, however, they cannot suddenly choose to act earlier than their chosen place in the turn order; they must wait until the participant they chose has acted before using whatever remaining actions they may have for the turn.</p></div>',1),s=[i];function r(h,l){return a(),t("div",null,s)}const m=e(o,[["render",r],["__file","combat.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/guide/rules/wwn/combat.html","title":"WWN Combat","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"id":"wwn-combat","title":"WWN Combat","description":"Rounds, Initiative, and Surprise Combat and other time-sensitive situations are broken into rounds, each of which is roughly six seconds in length.

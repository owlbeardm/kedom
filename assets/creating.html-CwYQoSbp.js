Ancestry</span></a></h3><p><em>Your character’s ancestry determines which people they call their own (humans, elves, dwarves or any of the other folk). Ancestries express the culture your character hails from. Within many ancestries are heritages — subgroups that each have their own characteristics. An ancestry provides ability boosts (and perhaps ability flaws), Hit Points, ancestry feats, and sometimes additional abilities.</em></p><ul><li>Pick the ancestry itself: <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ancestries</a>.</li><li>Select a <strong>heritage</strong> from those available within that ancestry (Can be found in Heritages submenu on selected Ancestry page).

Class</span></a></h3><p><em>Your characters class indicates the training they have and will improve upon as an adventurer. Choosing your character’s class is perhaps the most important decision you will make for them. Each class page has detailed information on how you can play that class, the initial abilities you gain at 1st level, and the class features you gain as you level up. Pay attention to your class&#39;s Key Ability Score, as your character gets a bonus to that ability score at first level and it will be the one that sets the DC for your class’s abilities and spells.</em></p><ul><li>Pick a class: <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classes</a></li><li>Note a <strong>Key Ability</strong> of this class.</li><li>Class almost always have suboption (like Research Fields for Alchemist or Arcane Schools and Arcane Thesis for wizard).

Your <strong>class&#39;s kit</strong> is a suggested list of items to purchase at 1st level and there are several <strong>sample builds</strong> to show an example of character creation for certain styles of play. Lastly, some classes have the option to choose a &quot;sub-class&quot; at first level (e.g. the alchemist gets to choose a <strong>research field</strong>, the barbarian gets to choose an <strong>instinct</strong>, etc.).

Abilities</span></a></h3><p>During character creation, there are 4 steps that are used to determine your ability scores. Each ability score starts at 10, representing human average, but as you make character choices, you&#39;ll adjust these scores by applying ability boosts, which increase a score by 2, and ability flaws, which decrease a score by 2. As you build your character, remember to apply ability score adjustments when making the following decisions. When you gain multiple ability boosts at the same time, you must apply each one to a different score.</p><ul><li><strong>Ancestry</strong>: Each ancestry provides ability boosts, and sometimes an ability flaw. You can also choose to take two additional ability flaws to gain an additional free ability boost. You can apply these flaws and boost to ability scores that already recieved boosts and flaws, but you can&#39;t finish this step with a score greater than 12 or lower than 8.</li><li><strong>Background</strong>: Your character&#39;s background provides two ability boosts.</li><li><strong>Class</strong>: Your character&#39;s class provides an ability boost to the ability score most important to your class, called your key ability score.</li><li><strong>Determine Scores</strong>: After the other steps, you apply four more ability boosts of your choice. Then, determine your ability modifiers based on those scores.</li></ul><h3 id="step-6-skills" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-6-skills"><span>Step 6.

Each skill is keyed to one of your character’s ability scores and used for an array of related actions.</em></p><p>During character creation, you become trained in a number of skills; some of them are specified by your class, background, or selected feats, but you also can freely select several of them (as indicated in class entry).

Feats</span></a></h3><p><em>Feats represent specialized abilities or training that your character possesses. There are several different types of feats. Ancestry feats, archetype feats, and class feats are located on their respective ancestry, archetype, or class page.</em></p><p>At 1st level you gain Ancestry Feat.

Also, some classes provide Class Feat at 1st level.</p><h3 id="step-8-spells" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-8-spells"><span>Step 8. Spells</span></a></h3><p><em>Some classes, including the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard, get access to spellcasting as part of their class features, but other classes can also gain spellcasting ability from their class feats, by taking certain archetypes, or by taking certain ancestry feats that grant focus spells, innate spells, or cantrips.</em></p><p>Spellcasting can be either <strong>prepared</strong> or <strong>spontaneous</strong>; If you’re a <strong>prepared spellcaster</strong> — such as a cleric, druid, or wizard — you must spend time each day preparing spells for that day. At the start of your daily preparations, you select a number of spells of different spell levels determined by your character level and class. Your spells remain prepared until you cast them or until you prepare spells again. If you’re a <strong>spontaneous spellcaster</strong> — such as a bard or a sorcerer — you choose which spell you’re using a spell slot for at the moment you decide to cast it. This provides you with more freedom in your spellcasting, but you have fewer spells in your spell repertoire, as determined by your character level and class. When you make your daily preparations, all your spell slots are refreshed, but you don’t get to change the spells in your repertoire.</p><p>All spells can be found under the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spells</a>. There are four traditions of spellcasting (<strong>arcane</strong>, <strong>divine</strong>, <strong>occult</strong>, and <strong>primal</strong>) and each tradition has access to a different list of spells that they can cast.</p><p>Characters of spellcasting classes can cast a certain number of spells each day; the spells you can cast in a day are referred to as <strong>spell slots</strong>. At 1st level, a character has only a small number of 1st-level spell slots per day, but as you advance in level, you gain more spell slots and new slots for higher-level spells. A spell’s level indicates its overall power, from 1 to 10.</p><h3 id="step-9-equipment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-9-equipment"><span>Step 9.

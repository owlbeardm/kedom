REWARD JUDGMENT (Example)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>-4</td><td><strong>Helpful</strong>: (Intimate; someone with whom you have an implicit trust; a lover or spouse)</td><td><strong>Fantastic</strong>: (The reward for accepting the deal is very worthwhile; the risk is either acceptable or extremely unlikely. The best-case scenario is a virtual guarantee. Example: An offer to pay a lot of gold for information that isn&#39;t important to the character.)</td></tr><tr><td>-3</td><td><strong>Friendly</strong>: (someone with whom you have a regularly positive personal relationship; a long-time buddy or sibling)</td><td><strong>Good</strong>: (The reward is good and the risk is minimal. The subject is very likely to proift from the deal. Example: An offer to pay someone twice their normal daily wage to spend their evening in a seedy tavern with a reputation for vicious brawls and later report on everyone they saw there.)</td></tr><tr><td>-2</td><td><strong>Ally</strong>: (someone on the same team, but with whom you have no personal relationship; a cleric of the same religion or a knight serving the same king)</td><td><strong>Favorable</strong>: (The reward is appealing, but there&#39;s risk involved. If all goes according to plan, though, the deal will end up benefiting the subject. Example: A request for a mercenary to aid the party in battle against a weak goblin tribe in return for a cut of the money and first pick of the magic items.)</td></tr><tr><td>-1</td><td><strong>Acquaintance</strong> — Positive: (someone you&#39;ve met several times with no particularly negative experiences; the blacksmith that buys your looted equipment regularly)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td><strong>Indifferent</strong>: (Doesn&#39;t care about you either way. Most NPCs start out indifferent.)</td><td><strong>Even</strong>: (The reward and risk more of less even out; or the deal involves neither reward nor risk. Example: A request for directions to a place that isn&#39;t a secret.)</td></tr><tr><td>+1</td><td><strong>Unfriendly</strong>: (someone you&#39;ve met several times with no particularly positive experience; the town guard that has arrested you for drunkenness once or twice)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>+2</td><td><strong>Hostile</strong>: (someone on an opposed team with whom you have no personal relationship; a cleric of an opposed religion or the orc bandit robbing you)</td><td><strong>Unfavorable</strong>: (The reward is not enough compared to the risk involved. Even if all goes according to plan, chances are it will end badly for the subject. Example: A request to free a prisoner the target is guarding for a small amount of money.)</td></tr><tr><td>+3</td><td><strong>Personal Foe</strong>: (someone with whom you have a regularly antagonistic personal relationship; an evil overlord you&#39;re trying to thwart or a bounty hunter sworn to track you down)</td><td><strong>Bad</strong>: (The reward is poor and the risk is high. The subject is very likely to get the raw end of the deal. Example: A request for a mercenary to aid the party in battle against an ancient red dragon for a small cut of any non-magical treasure.)</td></tr><tr><td>+4</td><td><strong>Nemesis</strong>: (someone who has sworn to do you, personally, harm; the brother of a man you murdered in cold blood)</td><td><strong>Horrible</strong>: (There is no conceivable way that the proposed plan could end up with the subject ahead or the worst-case scenario is guaranteed to occur. Example: An offer to trade a rusty kitchen knife for a shiny new longsword.)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="doors-and-walls" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#doors-and-walls"><span>Doors and Walls</span></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Force Open DC</th><th>Climb DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wooden Door or Window</td><td>8 (+1 if Hard)</td><td>10 (15 Reinforced)</td></tr><tr><td>Wooden Slats Wall</td><td>—</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Wooden Portcullis</td><td>10 (Lift)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Stone Door or Window</td><td>10 (+1 if Hard)</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Crumbling Masonry Wall</td><td>—</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Masonry Wall</td><td>—</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Hewn Stone</td><td>—</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Door or Window</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Wall</td><td>—</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Portcullis</td><td>12 (lift or Bend Bars)</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table>',16),i=[o];function n(l,s){return d(),e("div",null,i)}const m=t(a,[["render",n],["__file","game-tables.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/guide/rules/wwn/tools/game-tables.html","title":"WWN Game Tables","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"id":"wwn-tables","title":"WWN Game Tables","description":"Simple DC DC By Level If the spell is uncommon or rare, its difficulty should be adjusted accordingly Diplomacy Checks *Modified by relationship. **Modified by relationship and ...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://vuepress-theme-hope-docs-demo.netlify.app/guide/rules/wwn/tools/game-tables.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Kedôm"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"WWN Game Tables"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Simple DC DC By Level If the spell is uncommon or rare, its difficulty should be adjusted accordingly Diplomacy Checks *Modified by relationship. **Modified by relationship and ..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-05-16T21:01:04.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"OwlbearDM"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-05-16T21:01:04.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"WWN Game Tables\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-05-16T21:01:04.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"OwlbearDM\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://owlbeardm.com\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Simple DC","slug":"simple-dc","link":"#simple-dc","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"DC By Level","slug":"dc-by-level","link":"#dc-by-level","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Diplomacy","slug":"diplomacy","link":"#diplomacy","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Checks","slug":"checks","link":"#checks","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Modifiers","slug":"modifiers","link":"#modifiers","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Doors and Walls","slug":"doors-and-walls","link":"#doors-and-walls","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1698791759000,"updatedTime":1715893264000,"contributors":[{"name":"c7d5a6","email":"godinfrog@gmail.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.72,"words":817},"filePathRelative":"guide/rules/wwn/tools/game-tables.md","localizedDate":"October 31, 2023","autoDesc":true}');export{m as comp,p as data};

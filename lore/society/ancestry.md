## Дварфы

Deep beneath the towering mountains, the resilient and proud Dwarves have carved intricate subterranean cities showcasing their unmatched mining and craftsmanship abilities. With a sturdy physique and exceptional skills as smiths and stonemasons, these artisans embody strength, excellence, and an unwavering devotion to their craft. Adorned with elaborate facial hair, intricately braided in clan designs and adorned with precious metals, Dwarves are a sight to behold, radiating a sense of honor and resilience.

However, these proud beings are not without their flaws. Possessing an insatiable greed and a deep-rooted love for their treasures, Dwarves guard their hoards in expansive vaults, casting a wary and suspicious eye upon outsiders. Strangers, especially those not of dwarven kin, are met with quick anger and rash actions, for the Dwarves are slow to trust and quick to defend their wealth. The sight of the vast ocean instills fear in their hearts, prompting them to retreat to the safety of their mountain realms, far from the treacherous waters.

Yet amidst their negative traits, the Dwarves' extraordinary craftsmanship, mastery of masonry, and expertise in tempering steel have elevated them to legendary status. Their creations, born of tireless dedication, rival the artistry of the Elven metalworkers and far surpass the trinkets of Men. Dwelling in the timeless grandeur of the Dwarven Mountains, their subterranean cities teem with bustling trade and relentless industry, where carefully honed skills are exchanged and shared.

Whispers of the Dwarves' presence extend to the Long Mountains, where their resilience gives way to a more distant and untamed nature. Legends shrouded in chilling mystery speak of the Night Mountains, rumored to be home to secretive Dwarven kingdoms. Communicating through their ancient tongue of Khuzdûl, these stout beings proudly refer to themselves as Khazâd, forever etching their name in the annals of this fantastical world.
